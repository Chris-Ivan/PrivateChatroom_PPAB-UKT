## Chatroom WebApp [Frontend]
![chatroom-home](https://i.ibb.co/pjcq6QK/chatroom-home-min.jpg)

### Introduction
A simple database-less chat web app created for fun. I initially was following a [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwFA3YMfkoc&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery) by [Javascript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmXmlB4-HJytD7wek0Uo97A) before I decided to change the whole CSS and add a notification bar at the chatroom page. This is the main repository containing the frontend side off the web app code. The backend repository is available [here](https://github.com/Chris-Ivan/PrivateChatroom_PPAB-UKT_BE). I hosted the frontend on [Netlify](https://ppab-private-chatroom.netlify.app/) and the backend on [Heroku](https://private-chatroom-ppab-ukt-20.herokuapp.com/).<br>
<b>Technologies:</b> ReactJS, Socket.io, Netlify, Heroku

### Demo
The website is now live on [https://ppab-private-chatroom.netlify.app/](https://ppab-private-chatroom.netlify.app/)(Updated 29/10/2020). To use the chatroom, just fill in the username and room name from the landing page. You will be redirected to the main chatroom page. Have fun!

### What I Changed
- Overwrote most of the CSS with custom images and adapt the design to fit the design theme of the organization I'm in.
- Added a responsive design for mobile
- Added a simple notification bar for the chatroom.

### Setup

- install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (if you haven't)
- `git clone https://github.com/Chris-Ivan/PrivateChatroom_PPAB-UKT` the repository, then `cd` into the directory cloned.
- `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- `npm start` to run the app in the development mode
